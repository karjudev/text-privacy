Code attached to the Bachelor's degree thesis in Computer Science at the University of Pisa.

To run this code you'll need to setup a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) using Python 3.7 and to install the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `feature-engine`
- `matplotlib`
In this way you can just explore the `Playground.ipynb` notebook.
